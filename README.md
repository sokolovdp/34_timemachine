# Timer for Websites 

This project uses "code injection" technique, to inject timer code into pages of different sites. It requires special extension for Chrome browser.

# Installing

To generate **index.js** injection code  was used **staticjinja** package.

Install extension for Chrome browser [Custom JavaScript for websites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija).

1) Open configuration of [CJS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) 
browser extension on the site you want to controll, then paste **index.js** with timer code into CJS window.

2) You can upload into CJS short JS code from file **rawgit_starter.js**,  which will upload index.js from RAW GIT CDN
